##  Visualisation using Open3D

Using [Open3d]()http://www.open3d.org/) to visualise the predicted 
validation images.

### install open3d
`pip install open3d`

### Run the demo file
`python ./demo/open3d_vis_kaggle.py`

Press `q` to see next valid image.

There are some parameters need to be set, in the visualisation code, I hard coded them

```
car_model_dir =  The car models in json
valid_pred_file = Your predicted valid.pkl file
train_img_dir = Training images dir
train_df = Kaggle train.csv
```

There is also a default view point file that I have customised for us.
How to use it: open the `demo/open3d_view.json` copy it (`Ctrl+C`) and paste it on the Open3d visualisation window.

### Color denoatation

- ![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) `A False Positive (Wrong prediction)`
- ![#00ff00](https://placehold.it/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) `A True positive: if it's a bit red, then it's less accuracte because of translation mismatch`
- ![#0000ff](https://placehold.it/15/0000ff/000000?text=+) `A True positive: if it's a bit blue, then it's less accuracte because of the rotation mismatach`

- ![#f0f0f0](https://placehold.it/15/f0f0f0/000000?text=+) `A False Negative (Missing detection)`
